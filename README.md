# Carbon Emissions Analytics Dashboard

## Introduction

### Objective

The primary objective of our project is to analyze daily carbon emissions originating from US domestic flights and the environmental impact associated with electricity, natural gas, and coal consumption. Our goal is to promote sustainability by advocating for practices like reducing non-essential travel, opting for eco-friendly travel options, and selecting renewable and environmentally responsible services.

### Motivation

Carbon emissions have consistently posed a significant threat to the environment, contributing to various issues like global warming, alterations in weather patterns, and rising average temperatures. Unfortunately, due to human negligence and a lack of sufficient attention to the matter, carbon emissions have become a pressing global concern. This issue urgently demands global attention. Through this project, our goal is to harness the capabilities of cloud computing services to analyze and mitigate carbon emissions associated with flights, electricity, and fossil fuels consumption. These factors collectively contribute to significant carbon footprints, and addressing them is crucial for environmental sustainability.

### Scope

The scope of this project includes building an interactive dashboard that allows users to perform comprehensive data analysis and study the long term adverse effects of carbon footprint on the environment and ecology through a causal inference of the data. Users can additionally educate themselves about the sustainability initiatives and green solutions for curbing these issues.

#### Features

The following features will be incorporated in the dashboard:
- Monitor and analyze carbon emissions associated with a broad range of emission generating activities in the modern world.
  - Aggregate the carbon footprint created by daily domestic flights running in the US through air traffic monitoring techniques and sophisticated methodologies to calculate greenhouse gas (CO2, Nitrogen Oxide, water vapors, etc.) emissions by considering factors such as distance traveled, number of passengers, cargo load, etc.
  - Compute the real-time aggregated carbon emissions based on the electricity consumption estimates of different US states.
- Understand the correlation between fuel usage (Coal, Natural Gas, Petroleum) and CO2 emissions associated with different sectors such as Commercial, Industrial, Residential, etc.

### Stakeholders

The following diverse group of stakeholders can utilize our dashboard analytics to lead innovative sustainability initiatives in their respective sectors:

- **Aviation Sector:** Major airlines, regional airports, and industry associations play pivotal roles in emissions reduction within the domestic flight domain. Our flight emissions analytics can aid them in inspecting frequent flight routes and incorporating green solutions and optimization strategies that can help curb the massive carbon footprint generated by the aviation industry.

- **Environmental Advocates:** Environmental organizations and advocates champion sustainability, influencing both aviation and digital sectors. They can use our dashboard to influence sustainable and environmentally responsible initiatives on a government and organizational level, and direct funds to the right cause.

- **Regulatory Bodies:** Government agencies and regulators oversee compliance with environmental standards in aviation and internet governance. They can be persuaded to make strong regulatory laws that promote sustainability within these sectors.

- **Consumers and Users:** Individuals and organizations, as end-users, impact emissions through choices in travel and energy consumption activities, making them pivotal stakeholders in sustainability advocacy.

## Dataset

We will be utilizing a wide range of datasets for the different components of our projects.

- **US Energy Information Administration (EIA):** We will be using the open-sourced EIA data to calculate and visualize CO2 emissions and carbon coefficients by different fuels (Coal, Natural Gas, Petroleum) and sectors (Residential, Industrial, Commercial) in US states.
  - [EIA CO2 Emissions Data](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/co2-emissions/co2-emissions-aggregates)

- **US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):** This dataset provides information about environmental activities that may affect air, water, and land anywhere in the United States. We will be mapping this information with carbon emissions and check if there is any correlation, and visualize the overall environmental impact.
  - [EPA Envirofacts Data Service API](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/envirofacts-data-service-api)

- **OpenSky Network API:** This open-source API helps retrieve live airspace information, which, in our case, can help in monitoring daily flight traffic information domestically in the United States. This information will subsequently be used to calculate daily carbon emissions generated by flights in the US.

## Gap Analysis

At present, there is a lack of widespread awareness among individuals and organizations about the significant contributions of domestic flights, digital technologies, increasing coal and electricity to carbon emissions and climate change. There is also a lack of a centralized dashboard that documents and analyzes carbon emissions generated from different commercial/industrial/residential activities. Data related to it is dispersed making it difficult to analyze and evaluate. This project aims to bridge the existing gap by raising awareness and fostering a sense of responsibility among individuals and organizations, encouraging greener choices. The project seeks to create a cohesive and centralized platform for data integration, enabling comprehensive analysis of carbon emissions.

## System Architecture

### Data Collection

Data is collected from various third-party REST API sources. We will be focusing on flight monitoring data, fuel & sector emissions data, and CO2 emissions generated from electricity consumption. For the purposes of this project, the region for all the data components will be restricted to the USA. The detailed methodologies and data source links to extract data are listed below:

1. **Air Traffic Monitoring & Carbon Emissions Calculation**

   Data:
   - [OpenSky Network API - Arrivals by Airport](https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/rest.html#arrivals-by-airport)
   - [OpenSky Network API - Departures by Airport](https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/rest.html#departures-by-airport)
   - [ICAO Identifiers for US Airports](https://github.com/ip2location/ip2location-iata-icao/blob/master/iata-icao.csv)
   
   Process:
   - Monitor and calculate aggregated carbon emissions generated by daily flight departures in frequently visited US airports.
   - Fetch daily air traffic data with a delay of 1 day from the OpenSky Network API.
   - Build an adjacency graph of flights for monitoring current air traffic to avoid double-counting carbon emissions.
2. **CO2 Emissions Aggregate and CO2 Coefficients**

   Data:
   - [US Energy Information Administration (EIA) - CO2 Emissions Aggregates](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/co2-emissions/co2-emissions-aggregates)
   - [US Energy Information Administration (EIA) - CO2 Emissions and Carbon Coefficients](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/co2-emissions/co2-emissions-and-carbon-coefficients)

   Process:
   - Calculate CO2 emissions based on fuel, sector, and US states.
   - Predict future CO2 emissions in different states based on current consumption patterns.

## Data Transformation and Storage

The data from the API sources is extracted on lambda functions on a daily basis via Amazon EventBridge. Within these lambda functions, data cleaning, data manipulation, and data transformation are done to get the desired results. Furthermore, these calculations are stored in Amazon S3 in a JSON format. 

## Data Analysis & Visualization
For analyzing the data, we have built an interactive dashboard with a flask backend. The architecture of our dashboard is shown below.

## Redis Caching

We have implemented Redis for caching the result calculations during daily runs, so that if the dashboard is run multiple times a day, the result will be extracted from the Redis Cache. 


## Installation
